#+title: Stable mass transfer 2.0 @ CCA

* Objective

Implement in MESA =run_binary_extras.f90= physically motivated
alternative to rotationally-limited MT, possibly accounting for disk
wind and L2 losses.

Using [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/24.08.1/][MESA r24.08.1]].

* Initial discussion:

- the disk always fits within the Roche lobe (no truncation needed)
- L2 mass loss is energetically possible (cf.
  [[https://github.com/wenbinlu/L2massloss][L2 mass loss code]]), but can be added later
- the important thing to implement are dot(M2) and dot(J2) through the boundary layers.
** Input & outputs

Input: $\dot{M1}$, \omega_{accretor, surf}, M_{1}, M_{2}, a
Output: $\dot{M2}$, $\dot{J_{}}_{2}$

Routines to be used:
- =mod_other_accreted_material_j.f90=
- =mod_other_adjust_mdots.f90=

*N.B.:* we should also use the [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...198..383L/abstract][Lubow & Shu 1975]] results to use this
 *only if* a disk does form (not for direct impact)
