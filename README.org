#+title: Stable mass transfer 2.0 @ CCA

* Objective

Implement in MESA =run_binary_extras.f90= physically motivated
alternative to rotationally-limited MT, possibly accounting for disk
wind and L2 losses.

* Initial discussion:

- the disk always fits within the Roche lobe (no truncation needed)
- L2 mass loss is energetically possible (cf.
  [[https://github.com/wenbinlu/L2massloss][L2 mass loss code]]), but can be added later
- the important thing to implement are dot(M2) and dot(J2) through the boundary layers.
